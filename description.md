## Assignment

Movie and Series Management Application with Authentication, File Upload, and
API Features

### Description

You have been assigned to build a Node.js application to manage movies and
series content. The application should allow users to perform CRUD operations on movies and
series, including authentication, file upload, and other API features.

### Requirements

**User Authentication:**

● Include authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API
endpoints.

● Use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store
the tasks.

● Include password reset and email verification mechanisms.

● Use Git for version control and provide a repository with your commits.

**Movie and Series Management:**

● Implement CRUD operations for movies and series including adding, updating,
deleting, and retrieving movies and series details.

● Each Movie and Series should have properties such as title, genre, release year,
director, duration, and a brief description.

● Implement file upload functionality to allow users to upload movies and series
posters or cover images.

● Implement search functionality to allow users to search for movies and series by
title, genre, or cast crew details.

● Implement pagination and sorting and searching for listing movies and series.

● Implement endpoints to manage season and episode based on series.

● User Activity Logs: Implement user activity logging to keep track of user actions
within the application, such as movie/series additions, updates, and deletions.
Store relevant information like the timestamp, user ID, action performed, and
affected resource. This feature will be valuable for auditing, troubleshooting, and
monitoring user behavior.

● Implement endpoints to retrieve trending movies and series based on popularity
or ratings.

**API Features:**

● Implement user authorization to secure API endpoints.

● Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin, user) for different actions.

● Implement endpoints to retrieve user-specific data (e.g., movies/series added by
a user).

**Error Handling and Validation:**

● Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes and
error messages.

● Implement validation for data input (e.g., required fields, data types, date
formats).
